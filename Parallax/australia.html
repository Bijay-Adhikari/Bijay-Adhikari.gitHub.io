          <p class="subsection-left-text">Australia is a vibrant and diverse country that offers a high standard of living. The cost of living varies depending on the location and lifestyle of the student. Major cities such as Sydney and Melbourne are more expensive than smaller cities and towns. The average cost of living in Australia is around AUD 20,000 to 25,000 per year, which includes accommodation, food, transport, and other expenses.
